# ClassicCalendar
A World of Warcraft Classic addon looking to provide some basic calendar and scheduling functionality.

Does nothing of any usefulness currently, but hopefully will soon.

## Installation

- Click the releases tab above
- Find the release you want, download the source code (.zip)
- Extract to `[your wow folder]/_classic_/Interface/AddOns`
- Ensure that your directory structure looks like:  `/AddOns/ClassicCalendar/...files`

Upon loading the game, `Classic Calendar` should be in the addon list.
